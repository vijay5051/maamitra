## Active task
Fix Community comment owner actions: users could not edit/delete their own comments.

## Status
✅ Done by Codex. Root causes: comment editing was not implemented,
delete was exposed only as a tiny icon, and delete confirmation used
`Alert.alert`, which is unreliable on web/Safari in this repo. Added inline
Edit/Save/Cancel/Delete actions for the comment owner and cross-platform
delete confirmation.

## Last action
Committed and pushed `068f156 Enable editing and deleting own comments`
to `main`. Published Android/iOS OTA update group
`5edfdf51-5e22-4ccc-a88d-28dd6b1951bb` and deployed Firebase Hosting.
`npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

## Next step
None for this owner-action fix. If a specific comment still cannot be edited
or deleted, inspect that comment document's `authorUid` against the signed-in
user uid.

## In-flight side processes (don't accidentally restart these)
- **EAS Android build:** `90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b` —
  versionCode 22, includes AD_ID plugin + Codex's recovered morning
  work. Watch progress at:
  https://expo.dev/accounts/rockingvsr/projects/maamitra/builds/90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b
  When finished, the user uploads the AAB manually to Play Console.

## Known constraints / gotchas
- **Shared branch is `main` only.** Do not create `codex/*` or `feat/*`
  branches. Pull/rebase before work, before every commit, and push
  immediately after every commit.
- **"Push" means user-facing deploy.** After pushing JS-only changes to
  `main`, run `npm run update` for Android/iOS OTA and deploy web hosting.
- **`scripts/safe-update.sh`** guards `npm run update` against publishing
  from a dirty / out-of-sync tree. It now auto-supplies the latest commit
  subject as `--message`, `--environment production`, and `--non-interactive`.
  Bypass only via `SAFE_UPDATE_BYPASS=1`.

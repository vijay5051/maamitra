## Active task
Fix Community comment count showing 0 while comments are visible.

## Status
In progress by Codex. Patched comment count reconciliation to merge both
comment arrays (`comments` and `commentList`) instead of letting an empty loaded
list mask existing comments. Loading comments now also repairs the parent
Firestore `commentCount` / latest-comment summary from the actual subcollection.

## Last action
Edited `components/community/PostCard.tsx`, `store/useCommunityStore.ts`, and
`services/social.ts`. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes. Commit/push/OTA/web deploy
still pending.

## Next step
Pull/rebase main, commit, push, run `npm run update`, then deploy web hosting.

## In-flight side processes (don't accidentally restart these)
- **EAS Android build:** `90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b` —
  versionCode 22, includes AD_ID plugin + Codex's recovered morning
  work. Watch progress at:
  https://expo.dev/accounts/rockingvsr/projects/maamitra/builds/90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b
  When finished, the user uploads the AAB manually to Play Console.

## Known constraints / gotchas
- **Shared branch is `main` only.** Do not create `codex/*` or `feat/*`
  branches. Pull/rebase before work, before every commit, and push
  immediately after every commit.
- **"Push" means user-facing deploy.** After pushing JS-only changes to
  `main`, run `npm run update` for Android/iOS OTA and deploy web hosting.
- **`scripts/safe-update.sh`** guards `npm run update` against publishing
  from a dirty / out-of-sync tree. It now auto-supplies the latest commit
  subject as `--message`, `--environment production`, and `--non-interactive`.
  Bypass only via `SAFE_UPDATE_BYPASS=1`.

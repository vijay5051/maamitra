## Active task
Fix Community comment count showing `0` while a comment is visible.

## Status
✅ Done by Codex. Root cause: post cards trusted the denormalized
`post.commentCount` first. If the parent community post document had stale
`commentCount: 0` while the comments subcollection or `lastComment` had a
real comment, the UI still rendered `0`.

## Last action
Committed and pushed `7c4d400 Fix community comment count drift` to `main`.
Published Android/iOS OTA update group
`50a90598-3625-401f-bf0c-16e80b26595a` and deployed Firebase Hosting.
`npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

## Next step
None for this count drift. If an old post still shows a mismatch after a
fresh reload, inspect the parent `communityPosts/{postId}.commentCount`
versus its comments subcollection; the UI now reconciles loaded data.

## In-flight side processes (don't accidentally restart these)
- **EAS Android build:** `90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b` —
  versionCode 22, includes AD_ID plugin + Codex's recovered morning
  work. Watch progress at:
  https://expo.dev/accounts/rockingvsr/projects/maamitra/builds/90c536ef-e74c-4b1a-b245-e1f14bf22d0b
  When finished, the user uploads the AAB manually to Play Console.

## Known constraints / gotchas
- **Shared branch is `main` only.** Do not create `codex/*` or `feat/*`
  branches. Pull/rebase before work, before every commit, and push
  immediately after every commit.
- **"Push" means user-facing deploy.** After pushing JS-only changes to
  `main`, run `npm run update` for Android/iOS OTA and deploy web hosting.
- **`scripts/safe-update.sh`** guards `npm run update` against publishing
  from a dirty / out-of-sync tree. It now auto-supplies the latest commit
  subject as `--message`, `--environment production`, and `--non-interactive`.
  Bypass only via `SAFE_UPDATE_BYPASS=1`.
